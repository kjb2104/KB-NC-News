If you wish to run this and connect to the databases locally, you need to set the environment variables.

Instructions: 
* Ensure dotenv is installed 
* Create two files - .env.test and .env.development to store the environment variables - you can find the two names on the setup.sql file
* Add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names).
